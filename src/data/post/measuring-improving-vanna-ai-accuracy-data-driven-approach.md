## Overview

Accuracy measurement in Text-to-SQL systems presents unique challenges beyond traditional machine learning metrics. You need to evaluate not just syntactic correctness but also semantic equivalence and business value alignment. This guide provides a comprehensive framework for measuring, tracking, and continuously improving Vanna AI accuracy in production environments.

**What you'll learn:**
- How to build comprehensive accuracy testing frameworks
- Multiple accuracy metrics beyond simple pass/fail
- Confidence score calibration and reliability thresholds
- A/B testing strategies for training approaches
- Continuous improvement systems with automated feedback loops
- ROI analysis for training investment decisions

**Why accuracy measurement matters:**
In government and enterprise deployments, stakeholders require demonstrable, measurable improvements to justify AI investment. Generic "AI works well" claims don't satisfy compliance audits or budget reviews. You need systematic measurement, tracking, and continuous improvement processes.

> ⚠️ **Important**: This guide focuses on measurement methodology, not algorithm optimization. You'll measure Vanna AI's accuracy to guide training decisions, not modify Vanna's internal algorithms.

## Understanding Vanna AI Accuracy Challenges

Text-to-SQL accuracy differs fundamentally from traditional ML classification metrics. Your system can generate syntactically perfect SQL that returns completely wrong results due to business logic misunderstandings or schema misinterpretation.

### The Accuracy Gap

In production deployments, you'll observe a significant gap between different accuracy measures:

| Metric Type | Typical Range | What It Measures |
|-------------|---------------|------------------|
| Semantic Similarity | 85-90% | Text similarity between queries |
| Syntactic Correctness | 75-85% | SQL parses without errors |
| Business-Correct Results | 65-75% | Returns the right answer |
| User Satisfaction | 60-70% | User accepts without correction |

**Initial deployment** (Month 1):
- Simple queries: 70-80% accuracy
- Moderate queries (2-3 joins): 55-65% accuracy
- Complex queries (multiple joins, subqueries): 35-45% accuracy
- Overall blended: 60-70% accuracy

**After 3 months** of systematic optimization:
- Simple queries: 85-90% accuracy
- Moderate queries: 70-80% accuracy
- Complex queries: 55-65% accuracy
- Overall blended: 75-85% accuracy

**Mature implementation** (6+ months):
- Simple queries: 90-95% accuracy
- Moderate queries: 80-85% accuracy
- Complex queries: 65-75% accuracy
- Overall blended: 80-90% accuracy

> ℹ️ **Note**: These ranges reflect patterns observed across multiple government database implementations. Your specific accuracy will vary based on schema complexity, training data quality, and query diversity.

### Why Traditional Metrics Fail

**Challenge 1: Query Ambiguity**
Natural language inherently contains ambiguity. "Recent sales" could mean today, this week, or this month depending on business context. Semantic similarity scores can't detect this misinterpretation.

**Challenge 2: Schema Complexity**
Government databases often contain 200+ tables with similar column names. Vanna might correctly identify the need for a JOIN but select the wrong foreign key relationship.

**Challenge 3: Business Logic Requirements**
Queries often require implicit business rules—active records only, specific date ranges, security filters—that aren't obvious from the natural language question.

**Challenge 4: Context Dependencies**
Follow-up questions rely on previous conversation context that can drift over multiple exchanges.

> 💡 **Key Insight**: Measuring accuracy requires testing both syntactic correctness (does the SQL execute?) and semantic business value (does it answer the right question?).

## Key Concepts

### Concept 1: Multi-Dimensional Accuracy Measurement

You need multiple accuracy metrics to understand true system performance:

**Syntax Accuracy** - SQL parsing and structural correctness
- Measures: Does the generated SQL execute without errors?
- Value: Indicates basic SQL generation capability
- Limitation: Syntactically correct SQL can return wrong results

**Semantic Accuracy** - Logical equivalence of results
- Measures: Do generated and expected results match?
- Value: Indicates functional correctness
- Limitation: Doesn't account for schema or column selection

**Result Accuracy** - Business value correctness
- Measures: Does the result answer the user's actual question?
- Value: Reflects real-world usefulness
- Limitation: Requires human validation for edge cases

**Schema Accuracy** - Column and table selection correctness
- Measures: Are the right columns returned in the right order?
- Value: Indicates schema understanding
- Limitation: Correct schema can still have wrong filters

**When to use each metric:**

| Metric | Best For | Example Use Case |
|--------|----------|------------------|
| Syntax | Initial debugging | "Why is my SQL failing to execute?" |
| Semantic | Functional testing | "Are results logically equivalent?" |
| Result | Production validation | "Is this the answer users need?" |
| Schema | Training effectiveness | "Does it understand our schema?" |

**Trade-offs:**
- Higher accuracy requires more training data and validation effort
- Perfect accuracy isn't achievable—focus on predictable, reliable performance
- Confidence scores become more valuable than raw accuracy numbers

### Concept 2: Confidence Calibration

Vanna AI provides confidence scores, but these don't always correlate with actual accuracy. You need to calibrate confidence scores against observed accuracy to establish reliability thresholds.

**The Calibration Problem:**
Initial deployments show weak correlation (0.3-0.5) between confidence and accuracy. This means high-confidence predictions can be wrong, and low-confidence predictions can be correct.

**After Proper Training:**
With systematic training data curation, correlation improves to 0.7-0.8, making confidence scores useful for production routing decisions.

**Practical Application:**
You can route high-confidence queries to direct execution and low-confidence queries to human review, optimizing both accuracy and operational efficiency.

## Building a Comprehensive Query Accuracy Test Suite {#building-test-suites}

The foundation of accuracy measurement is systematic testing. You create test cases representing common query patterns, edge cases, and business-specific scenarios.

### Basic Test Framework

**Step 1: Define Test Case Structure**

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Dict, List
import pandas as pd
import json
from datetime import datetime

@dataclass
class QueryTestCase:
    """Represents a single accuracy test case"""
    id: str
    natural_language: str
    expected_sql: str
    expected_result_schema: Dict
    business_context: str
    difficulty_level: str  # 'basic', 'intermediate', 'advanced'
    categories: List[str]  # ['joins', 'aggregation', 'filtering']

# WHY: Structured test cases enable systematic accuracy measurement
# HOW: Each test case captures expected behavior across multiple dimensions
```

**Step 2: Create VannaAccuracyTester Class**

```python
class VannaAccuracyTester:
    """
    Comprehensive accuracy testing framework for Vanna AI systems.

    This class provides systematic measurement across multiple accuracy
    dimensions: syntax, semantics, results, and schema correctness.
    """

    def __init__(self, vanna_instance, test_database_connection):
        # WHY: Initialize with Vanna instance and test DB to enable
        # side-by-side comparison of expected vs. generated queries
        self.vanna = vanna_instance
        self.db_connection = test_database_connection
        self.test_cases = []
        self.results = []

    def load_test_cases(self, test_cases_file: str):
        """Load test cases from JSON file for reproducible testing"""
        # WHY: External JSON enables version control and sharing test suites
        with open(test_cases_file, 'r') as f:
            data = json.load(f)
            self.test_cases = [QueryTestCase(**case) for case in data['test_cases']]

        # HOW: Deserialize JSON into structured test case objects
```

> 💡 **Tip**: Maintain 150-200 test cases covering common patterns, edge cases, and business scenarios. Government implementations typically require broader test coverage due to schema complexity.

### Progressive Testing Implementation

**Basic: Single Test Execution**

```python
def execute_accuracy_test(self, test_case: QueryTestCase) -> Dict:
    """Execute single test case and measure accuracy"""
    start_time = datetime.now()

    try:
        # WHY: Generate SQL from natural language using Vanna
        generated_sql = self.vanna.generate_sql(test_case.natural_language)
        generation_time = (datetime.now() - start_time).total_seconds()

        # WHY: Execute both expected and generated queries for comparison
        expected_results = pd.read_sql(test_case.expected_sql, self.db_connection)
        generated_results = pd.read_sql(generated_sql, self.db_connection)

        # WHY: Calculate comprehensive accuracy metrics across dimensions
        accuracy_metrics = self._calculate_accuracy_metrics(
            test_case, generated_sql, expected_results, generated_results
        )

        return {
            'test_id': test_case.id,
            'generated_sql': generated_sql,
            'execution_successful': True,
            'generation_time_seconds': generation_time,
            **accuracy_metrics
        }

    except Exception as e:
        # WHY: Capture failures with context for debugging
        return {
            'test_id': test_case.id,
            'generated_sql': generated_sql if 'generated_sql' in locals() else None,
            'execution_successful': False,
            'error': str(e),
            'generation_time_seconds': (datetime.now() - start_time).total_seconds(),
            'syntax_accuracy': 0.0,
            'semantic_accuracy': 0.0,
            'result_accuracy': 0.0
        }
```

> ⚠️ **Warning**: Always execute generated SQL in isolated test environments, never production databases. Malformed queries can cause performance issues or unintended data modifications.

**Intermediate: Accuracy Metrics Calculation**

```python
def _calculate_accuracy_metrics(self, test_case, generated_sql,
                                expected_df, generated_df) -> Dict:
    """Calculate comprehensive accuracy metrics across multiple dimensions"""

    # WHY: Multi-dimensional metrics reveal different failure modes
    # Syntax failures differ from semantic failures differ from schema issues

    # Syntax accuracy - SQL parsing and structure
    syntax_score = self._calculate_syntax_accuracy(
        test_case.expected_sql, generated_sql
    )

    # Semantic accuracy - logical equivalence
    semantic_score = self._calculate_semantic_accuracy(
        expected_df, generated_df
    )

    # Result accuracy - business value correctness
    result_score = self._calculate_result_accuracy(
        expected_df, generated_df
    )

    # Schema accuracy - column selection correctness
    schema_score = self._calculate_schema_accuracy(
        test_case.expected_result_schema,
        generated_df.columns.tolist()
    )

    # HOW: Combine metrics into weighted overall score
    return {
        'syntax_accuracy': syntax_score,
        'semantic_accuracy': semantic_score,
        'result_accuracy': result_score,
        'schema_accuracy': schema_score,
        'overall_accuracy': (syntax_score + semantic_score +
                           result_score + schema_score) / 4
    }
```

**Advanced: Complete Test Suite Execution**

```python
def run_full_test_suite(self) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """Execute complete test suite and return comprehensive results"""
    results = []

    # WHY: Batch execution enables statistical analysis of accuracy patterns
    for test_case in self.test_cases:
        result = self.execute_accuracy_test(test_case)
        result['difficulty'] = test_case.difficulty_level
        result['categories'] = ','.join(test_case.categories)
        results.append(result)

    # HOW: Convert to DataFrame for analysis and visualization
    self.results = pd.DataFrame(results)
    return self.results

def generate_accuracy_report(self) -> Dict:
    """Generate comprehensive accuracy analysis with breakdowns"""
    if self.results.empty:
        return {}

    return {
        'overall_metrics': {
            'total_tests': len(self.results),
            'execution_success_rate': self.results['execution_successful'].mean(),
            'average_syntax_accuracy': self.results['syntax_accuracy'].mean(),
            'average_semantic_accuracy': self.results['semantic_accuracy'].mean(),
            'average_result_accuracy': self.results['result_accuracy'].mean(),
            'average_overall_accuracy': self.results['overall_accuracy'].mean()
        },
        # WHY: Difficulty breakdown reveals performance patterns
        'by_difficulty': self.results.groupby('difficulty').agg({
            'overall_accuracy': ['mean', 'std', 'count']
        }).round(3).to_dict(),
        # WHY: Distribution shows concentration of high/low accuracy
        'performance_distribution': {
            'high_accuracy_queries': (self.results['overall_accuracy'] >= 0.8).sum(),
            'medium_accuracy_queries': ((self.results['overall_accuracy'] >= 0.6) &
                                      (self.results['overall_accuracy'] < 0.8)).sum(),
            'low_accuracy_queries': (self.results['overall_accuracy'] < 0.6).sum()
        }
    }
```

### Individual Accuracy Metric Implementations

**Syntax Accuracy: SQL Token Comparison**

```python
def _calculate_syntax_accuracy(self, expected_sql: str, generated_sql: str) -> float:
    """Measure SQL syntax and structure similarity through token analysis"""
    # WHY: Token-based comparison reveals structural understanding
    # HOW: Parse SQL into tokens and calculate overlap percentage

    expected_tokens = self._parse_sql_tokens(expected_sql)
    generated_tokens = self._parse_sql_tokens(generated_sql)

    # Calculate Jaccard similarity: intersection / union
    common_tokens = set(expected_tokens) & set(generated_tokens)
    total_tokens = set(expected_tokens) | set(generated_tokens)

    return len(common_tokens) / len(total_tokens) if total_tokens else 0.0

def _parse_sql_tokens(self, sql: str) -> List[str]:
    """Parse SQL into tokens for comparison"""
    # WHY: Tokenization enables structural comparison beyond string matching
    # Normalize SQL: uppercase keywords, split on whitespace and punctuation
    sql_normalized = sql.upper()
    tokens = []

    # Simple tokenization (production systems should use SQL parser)
    import re
    tokens = re.findall(r'\b\w+\b', sql_normalized)

    return tokens
```

**Semantic Accuracy: Result Set Comparison**

```python
def _calculate_semantic_accuracy(self, expected_df: pd.DataFrame,
                                generated_df: pd.DataFrame) -> float:
    """Measure semantic equivalence of query results"""
    # WHY: Results must match even if SQL structure differs
    # Different SQL can produce identical results (semantic equivalence)

    if expected_df.shape != generated_df.shape:
        # Shape mismatch = wrong results
        return 0.0

    try:
        # WHY: Sort both DataFrames for order-independent comparison
        expected_sorted = expected_df.sort_values(
            expected_df.columns.tolist()
        ).reset_index(drop=True)
        generated_sorted = generated_df.sort_values(
            generated_df.columns.tolist()
        ).reset_index(drop=True)

        # HOW: Calculate row-wise accuracy percentage
        matching_rows = 0
        for i in range(len(expected_sorted)):
            if expected_sorted.iloc[i].equals(generated_sorted.iloc[i]):
                matching_rows += 1

        return matching_rows / len(expected_sorted)
    except:
        return 0.0
```

**Result Accuracy: Business Logic Validation**

```python
def _calculate_result_accuracy(self, expected_df: pd.DataFrame,
                              generated_df: pd.DataFrame) -> float:
    """Measure business value correctness beyond semantic equivalence"""
    # WHY: Business rules may allow variations in semantically equivalent results
    # Example: ORDER BY differences may be acceptable for some queries

    if len(expected_df) != len(generated_df):
        return 0.0

    # HOW: Compare with tolerance for business-acceptable variations
    # This implementation uses strict equality; customize for your business rules
    return 1.0 if expected_df.equals(generated_df) else 0.0

def _calculate_schema_accuracy(self, expected_schema: Dict,
                              generated_columns: List[str]) -> float:
    """Measure column selection correctness"""
    # WHY: Correct columns in correct order indicates schema understanding

    expected_columns = list(expected_schema.keys())

    # Calculate column overlap
    common_columns = set(expected_columns) & set(generated_columns)
    total_columns = set(expected_columns) | set(generated_columns)

    column_accuracy = len(common_columns) / len(total_columns) if total_columns else 0.0

    # Bonus for correct ordering (if columns match exactly)
    order_bonus = 0.0
    if expected_columns == generated_columns:
        order_bonus = 0.2

    return min(1.0, column_accuracy + order_bonus)
```

> 💡 **Best Practice**: Customize accuracy calculations based on your business requirements. Some use cases prioritize column accuracy over result ordering, others require exact matches.

## Measuring Confidence vs Actual Accuracy

Vanna AI provides confidence scores for generated SQL, but initial deployments show weak correlation between confidence and actual accuracy. You need to calibrate confidence scores to establish reliability thresholds for production routing decisions.

### Confidence Calibration Framework

```python
class ConfidenceCalibrator:
    """
    Calibrate Vanna confidence scores against actual accuracy.

    This enables production routing: high-confidence queries go to direct
    execution, low-confidence queries go to human review.
    """

    def __init__(self, vanna_instance):
        # WHY: Store Vanna instance to extract confidence metadata
        self.vanna = vanna_instance
        self.calibration_data = []

    def collect_confidence_accuracy_pairs(self, test_results: pd.DataFrame):
        """Collect confidence scores and actual accuracy for calibration"""
        # WHY: Build dataset correlating confidence predictions with outcomes

        for _, result in test_results.iterrows():
            if result['execution_successful']:
                # Extract confidence score from Vanna metadata
                confidence = self._extract_confidence_score(result['generated_sql'])
                actual_accuracy = result['overall_accuracy']

                self.calibration_data.append({
                    'confidence_score': confidence,
                    'actual_accuracy': actual_accuracy,
                    'test_id': result['test_id']
                })

    def _extract_confidence_score(self, generated_sql: str) -> float:
        """Extract confidence score from Vanna's response metadata"""
        # WHY: Vanna provides confidence in metadata (implementation-dependent)
        # HOW: Access last query's confidence score

        try:
            # Implementation depends on Vanna version
            return self.vanna.get_last_confidence_score()
        except:
            return 0.5  # Default neutral confidence if unavailable
```

> ℹ️ **Note**: Confidence score extraction depends on your Vanna version and configuration. Consult Vanna documentation for the appropriate metadata access method.

### Analyzing Calibration Quality

```python
def analyze_confidence_calibration(self) -> Dict:
    """Analyze how well confidence scores predict actual accuracy"""
    if not self.calibration_data:
        return {}

    df = pd.DataFrame(self.calibration_data)

    # WHY: Bin confidence scores to analyze accuracy within ranges
    # HOW: Create 5 bins from very low to very high confidence
    df['confidence_bin'] = pd.cut(
        df['confidence_score'],
        bins=[0, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9, 1.0],
        labels=['Very Low', 'Low', 'Medium', 'High', 'Very High']
    )

    # Calculate average accuracy per confidence bin
    calibration_analysis = df.groupby('confidence_bin').agg({
        'actual_accuracy': ['mean', 'std', 'count'],
        'confidence_score': 'mean'
    }).round(3)

    # WHY: Correlation coefficient reveals calibration quality
    # 0.3-0.5 = poor, 0.7-0.8 = good, >0.8 = excellent
    correlation = df['confidence_score'].corr(df['actual_accuracy'])

    return {
        'calibration_by_confidence': calibration_analysis.to_dict(),
        'correlation': correlation,
        'reliability_threshold': self._find_reliability_threshold(df)
    }

def _find_reliability_threshold(self, df: pd.DataFrame) -> float:
    """Find confidence threshold where accuracy consistently exceeds target"""
    # WHY: Establish threshold for production routing decisions
    # Queries above threshold go to direct execution
    # Queries below threshold go to human review

    target_accuracy = 0.8

    for threshold in [0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9]:
        high_confidence_queries = df[df['confidence_score'] >= threshold]

        # Require minimum sample size for statistical validity
        if len(high_confidence_queries) > 10:
            avg_accuracy = high_confidence_queries['actual_accuracy'].mean()
            if avg_accuracy >= target_accuracy:
                return threshold

    return 0.9  # Conservative default if no threshold meets criteria
```

### Confidence Calibration Metrics

| Confidence Range | Initial Accuracy | After Training | Sample Size |
|------------------|------------------|----------------|-------------|
| Very Low (0-0.3) | 40-50% | 45-55% | Need 20+ samples |
| Low (0.3-0.5) | 50-60% | 60-70% | Need 20+ samples |
| Medium (0.5-0.7) | 60-70% | 70-80% | Need 20+ samples |
| High (0.7-0.9) | 70-80% | 80-90% | Need 20+ samples |
| Very High (0.9-1.0) | 75-85% | 85-95% | Need 20+ samples |

> 💡 **Production Strategy**: Route queries with confidence ≥ 0.7 to direct execution, confidence 0.5-0.7 to automated validation, and confidence < 0.5 to human review.

## A/B Testing Different Training Approaches

Systematic improvement requires controlled experimentation. You create training variants with different strategies, test each against your test suite, and compare results to identify optimal approaches.

### Training Experiment Framework

```python
class VannaTrainingExperiment:
    """
    A/B testing framework for training approach comparison.

    Test different training data selection strategies to identify
    the most effective approach for your specific use case.
    """

    def __init__(self, base_vanna_instance, test_database):
        self.base_vanna = base_vanna_instance
        self.test_db = test_database
        self.experiments = {}
        self.results = {}

    def create_training_variant(self, variant_name: str, training_config: Dict):
        """Create a new training variant for A/B testing"""
        # WHY: Independent variants enable controlled comparison
        variant_vanna = vanna.create_instance(training_config)
        self.experiments[variant_name] = {
            'instance': variant_vanna,
            'config': training_config,
            'training_data': []
        }
```

### Common Training Approaches to Test

```python
def add_training_approaches(self):
    """Define different training approaches for systematic comparison"""

    # APPROACH A: High-volume general training
    # ✅ Pros: Broad coverage, handles diverse queries
    # ❌ Cons: Dilutes domain-specific patterns, longer training time
    # Best for: General-purpose deployments with diverse query types
    self.create_training_variant('high_volume_general', {

        'learning_rate': 0.001
    })

    # APPROACH B: Curated domain-specific training

    # ❌ Cons: May struggle with out-of-domain queries
    # Best for: Specialized applications with well-defined query patterns

## Creating Feedback Loops for Continuous Improvement

Production Vanna AI systems require ongoing maintenance and improvement. You build automated feedback collection, quality monitoring, and incremental training to maintain accuracy as data and usage evolve.

### Continuous Improvement System

```python
class ContinuousImprovementSystem:
    """
    Automated feedback collection and model improvement system.

    Collects user feedback, identifies improvement opportunities,
    and triggers automated retraining when accuracy degrades.
    """

    def __init__(self, vanna_instance, accuracy_threshold=0.8):
        self.vanna = vanna_instance
        self.accuracy_threshold = accuracy_threshold
        self.feedback_queue = []
        self.improvement_metrics = {}

    def collect_user_feedback(self, query: str, generated_sql: str,
                            user_rating: int, corrected_sql: str = None):
        """Collect user feedback for continuous improvement"""
        # WHY: User corrections are highest-quality training examples
        # HOW: Queue feedback for batch processing

        feedback_entry = {
            'timestamp': datetime.now(),
            'natural_language_query': query,
            'generated_sql': generated_sql,
            'user_rating': user_rating,  # 1-5 scale
            'corrected_sql': corrected_sql,
            'feedback_type': 'correction' if corrected_sql else 'rating'
        }

        self.feedback_queue.append(feedback_entry)

        # WHY: Trigger improvement when sufficient feedback accumulated
        if len(self.feedback_queue) >= 50:
            self.process_feedback_batch()
```

> ⚠️ **Important**: User feedback collection requires appropriate privacy controls and data retention policies, especially for government systems. Implement anonymization and consent mechanisms.

### Processing Feedback Batches

```python
def process_feedback_batch(self):
    """Process accumulated feedback and improve model"""
    if len(self.feedback_queue) < 10:
        return

    feedback_df = pd.DataFrame(self.feedback_queue)

    # WHY: Identify patterns in low-rated queries
    low_rated_queries = feedback_df[feedback_df['user_rating'] <= 2]
    corrected_queries = feedback_df[feedback_df['corrected_sql'].notna()]

    # WHY: User corrections are gold standard training examples
    new_training_examples = []
    for _, correction in corrected_queries.iterrows():
        new_training_examples.append({
            'question': correction['natural_language_query'],
            'sql': correction['corrected_sql'],
            'source': 'user_correction',
            'confidence': 1.0  # High confidence in human corrections
        })

    # Retrain with validated examples
    if new_training_examples:
        self.incremental_training(new_training_examples)

    # Clear processed feedback
    self.feedback_queue = []

def incremental_training(self, new_examples: List[Dict]):
    """Perform incremental training with new examples"""
    # WHY: Incremental training adds examples without full retraining
    # HOW: Vanna supports adding training examples to existing model

    print(f"Performing incremental training with {len(new_examples)} new examples")

    for example in new_examples:
        self.vanna.train(
            question=example['question'],
            sql=example['sql']

        'total_training_examples': self.vanna.get_training_data_count(),
        'improvement_trigger': 'user_feedback'
    }
```

### Automated Quality Monitoring

```python
def automated_quality_monitoring(self, test_cases: List[QueryTestCase]):
    """Monitor quality and trigger retraining when accuracy drops"""
    # WHY: Accuracy degrades over time as data and usage patterns evolve
    # HOW: Run test suite periodically, trigger improvement if below threshold

    tester = VannaAccuracyTester(self.vanna, self.test_db)
    tester.test_cases = test_cases
    current_results = tester.run_full_test_suite()

    current_accuracy = current_results['overall_accuracy'].mean()

    # Check if accuracy has dropped below threshold
    if current_accuracy < self.accuracy_threshold:
        print(f"Accuracy dropped to {current_accuracy:.3f}, triggering improvement cycle")
        self.trigger_improvement_cycle(current_results)

    return current_accuracy

def trigger_improvement_cycle(self, poor_performance_results: pd.DataFrame):
    """Trigger comprehensive improvement when performance drops"""
    # WHY: Targeted improvement addresses specific failure patterns

    # Identify worst-performing query types
    poor_queries = poor_performance_results[
        poor_performance_results['overall_accuracy'] < 0.5
    ]

    # Generate additional training examples for problem areas
    improvement_examples = self.generate_targeted_training_examples(poor_queries)

    # Perform focused retraining
    self.incremental_training(improvement_examples)

    # Schedule follow-up testing
    self.schedule_accuracy_retest()
```

## When to Retrain vs Fine-tune

One of the most critical decisions in maintaining Vanna AI accuracy is choosing between full retraining and incremental fine-tuning. You use different approaches based on accuracy degradation severity, schema changes, and business logic updates.

### Decision Framework

**Retrain Completely When:**
- Accuracy drops below 60% on core query types
- Schema changes affect more than 30% of tables
- Business logic requirements fundamentally change
- Initial training data quality was poor
- Correlation between confidence and accuracy deteriorates

**Fine-tune When:**
- Accuracy is 65-80% and needs incremental improvement
- New query patterns emerge but core functionality works
- User feedback provides specific corrections
- Adding new data sources to existing schema
- Confidence calibration needs adjustment

### Training Decision Engine

```python
class TrainingDecisionEngine:
    """

## Troubleshooting Common Accuracy Issues

When accuracy falls below expectations, you need systematic approaches to diagnose and resolve problems. Common issues fall into categories: data quality, schema understanding, query complexity, and configuration problems.

### Issue 1: Low Syntax Accuracy

**Symptoms:**
- Generated SQL fails to execute
- SQL syntax errors in logs
- Execution success rate below 80%

**Cause:**
Training data contains malformed SQL or inconsistent syntax patterns. Vanna learns incorrect SQL structure from low-quality examples.

**Solution:**
```python
# Validate all training SQL before adding to training set
def validate_training_sql(sql: str, db_connection) -> bool:
    """Validate SQL executes without errors"""
    try:
        pd.read_sql(f"EXPLAIN {sql}", db_connection)
        return True
    except:
        return False

# Filter training data to only include valid SQL
validated_training_data = [
    example for example in training_data
    if validate_training_sql(example['sql'], db_connection)
]
```

### Issue 2: Confidence-Accuracy Mismatch

**Symptoms:**
- High confidence queries returning wrong results
- Low confidence queries working correctly
- Correlation coefficient below 0.5

**Cause:**
Insufficient calibration data or training data quality issues causing confidence miscalibration.

**Solution:**
Collect more calibration data across confidence ranges and retrain with higher-quality examples:

```python
# Increase calibration dataset size
calibrator = ConfidenceCalibrator(vanna_instance)
calibrator.collect_confidence_accuracy_pairs(test_results)

# Focus training on high-confidence failures
high_conf_failures = test_results[
    (test_results['confidence_score'] > 0.7) &
    (test_results['overall_accuracy'] < 0.6)
]

# Add corrected versions to training data
for failure in high_conf_failures:
    vanna.train(
        question=failure['natural_language'],
        sql=failure['expected_sql']
    )
```

### Issue 3: Poor Performance on Complex Queries

**Symptoms:**
- Simple queries work well (80%+ accuracy)
- Complex queries fail consistently (below 50% accuracy)
- Accuracy degrades with JOIN complexity

**Cause:**
Insufficient training examples for complex query patterns. Simple queries dominate training data.

**Solution:**
Balance training data across complexity levels:

```python
# Analyze training data complexity distribution
complexity_counts = {}
for example in training_data:
    complexity = calculate_query_complexity(example['sql'])
    complexity_counts[complexity] = complexity_counts.get(complexity, 0) + 1

# Target: 40% simple, 40% moderate, 20% complex
# Add more complex examples if underrepresented
if complexity_counts.get('complex', 0) < len(training_data) * 0.2:
    # Generate or collect additional complex query examples
    additional_complex = collect_complex_query_examples(count=50)
    training_data.extend(additional_complex)
```

### Issue 4: Schema Accuracy Problems

**Symptoms:**
- Wrong columns selected
- Missing required columns
- Joins on incorrect foreign keys

**Cause:**
Vanna doesn't understand schema relationships or column semantics.

**Solution:**
Enhance schema documentation and add relationship examples:

```python
# Provide detailed schema documentation
vanna.train(ddl="""
CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    department_id INT,  -- References departments.department_id
    name VARCHAR(100),
    hire_date DATE,
    salary DECIMAL(10,2)
);

CREATE TABLE departments (
    department_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    department_name VARCHAR(100),
    budget DECIMAL(12,2)
);
""")

# Add examples demonstrating correct relationships
vanna.train(
    question="Show employees with their department names",
    sql="""
    SELECT e.name, d.department_name
    FROM employees e
    JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id
    """
)
```

## FAQ: Accuracy Measurement

> ❓ **How many test cases do I need for reliable accuracy measurement?**
>
> You need 150-200 test cases minimum for production systems. Include:
> - 40-50% simple queries (single table, basic filters)
> - 40-50% moderate queries (2-3 table joins, aggregations)
> - 10-20% complex queries (multiple joins, subqueries, advanced logic)
>
> Ensure coverage across all major query patterns, schema areas, and business use cases.

> ❓ **What's a realistic accuracy target for initial deployment?**
>
> Initial deployments typically achieve 60-70% blended accuracy. After 3 months of optimization, expect 75-85%. Mature implementations (6+ months) reach 80-90%.
>
> Don't aim for 100% accuracy—focus on predictable, reliable performance with clear confidence indicators.

> ❓ **How often should I retrain vs. fine-tune?**
>
> - **Fine-tune**: Every 2-4 weeks with user feedback (10-20 new examples)
> - **Full retrain**: Quarterly or when accuracy drops below 60%
> - **Continuous improvement**: Automated incremental training with validated user corrections
>
> Monitor accuracy weekly. Trigger retraining when accuracy drops 15% from peak.

> ❓ **Do I need separate test suites for each environment?**
>
> Yes, if schemas differ between environments. Maintain:
> - **Development suite**: Comprehensive coverage, all edge cases
> - **Staging suite**: Production-like data, realistic query distribution
> - **Production monitoring**: Automated testing on anonymized queries
>
> Development and staging suites can overlap significantly. Production monitoring focuses on regression detection.

> ❓ **How do I measure accuracy for queries with no right answer?**
>
> For exploratory or analytical queries without predetermined answers:
> 1. Validate SQL syntax correctness
> 2. Check schema appropriateness (correct tables/columns)
> 3. Verify business logic constraints (date ranges, filters)
> 4. Use expert review for semantic correctness
>
> Create "acceptable answer" ranges rather than exact matches.
