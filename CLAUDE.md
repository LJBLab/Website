## üìã Content Authenticity Standards

- **No Fabricated Statistics**: Never use specific numbers, percentages, or metrics without verifiable sources
- **Experience-Based Language**: Use "in our experience," "commonly observed," or "typical patterns" instead of specific claims
- **Relative Terms**: "Significantly faster," "substantial improvement" instead of "70% improvement," "3x faster"
- **Industry Patterns**: Focus on architectural patterns and best practices rather than specific implementations
- **Source Attribution**: Always cite sources for external statistics, benchmarks, or industry data

### ‚ùå Avoid These Practices
- Specific metrics without sources ("increased from $2,000 to $18,000/month")
- Exact timeframes without verification ("18 months in production")
- Precise tenant counts ("50+ tenants," "10+ agencies")
- Unverifiable uptime claims ("99.99% uptime")
- Fabricated case study details

### üìñ Reference Documents
- See `/CONTENT_GUIDELINES.md` for comprehensive content standards
- Review process: All content should be self-audited before publication
- Focus on providing genuine value through architecture insights and code examples
